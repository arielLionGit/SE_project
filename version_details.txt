Done:
1. All the functionality is working
(Main functions)
- Create a poll
- Delete a poll (Root and Admin only)
- View a poll
- Vote on a poll
- Download the results of a poll
- Admin levels
- Manage users (Root and Admin only)
- Change user type (Root only)
- Delete user (Root only)
- Automatically delete polls when reach end time (Admin can still view)



To be solved:
1. The cancel vote function unavailable
2. Still using local storage, need to figure out how to use database (Firebase suggested)
3. Figuring out how to host the website (Have a domain name which can lend from other)
4. Test if the AJAX auto-update can work
5. Root admin need to be included in default setup
6. The css in the html files should be all realocated into styles.css


Additional features can add:
1. Account security
2. DDOS protection
3. Enhance accessability (for colour blindness / low vision)
