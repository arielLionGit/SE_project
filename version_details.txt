Solved:
1. The cancel vote function available now
2.The css in the html files should be all realocated into styles.css
3. Enhance accessability (for colour blindness / low vision)


To be solved:
1. Still using local storage, need to figure out how to use database (Firebase suggested)
2. Figuring out how to host the website (Have a domain name which can lend from other)
3. Test if the AJAX auto-update can work
4. Root admin need to be included in default setup


Additional features can add:
1. Account security
2. DDOS protection
